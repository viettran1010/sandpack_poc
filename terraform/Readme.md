## Memos
- We aren't managing DNS on terraform currently.
- We're not using workspace feature for switching environment (staging / production), because it's for testing according to [the official document](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html#when-to-use-multiple-workspaces).
- See [the official best practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/) to keep this project clean and simple.
